# Physics Motivation

Several phenomena cannot be explained with known particles - neutrino masses and oscillation, dark matter, and baryon asymmetry of Universe, indicate clearly New Physics exists. This can also help to understand flavour structure, mass pattern, left-right symmetry in the fermionic sector, Planck scale related to universal gravitational interaction is so large in comparison to Fermi scale of electro-weak interaction. 

For dark matter, currently absent detection method for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) in GeV-TeV mass range. 

However, so far no convincing signs of new particles have been found suggests either heavier particle or weakly interacting particle exists. This inspires the search for Feebly Interacting Particles (FIPs) or long lived new particles, including heavy neutral leptons (HNL), dark photons (DP), dark scalars (DS), axion-like particles (ALP), light dark matter (LDM) and other super-weakly interacting light particles have now been included. 

However to be detected, identified and measured, new particles should decay or interact inside the detector with a significant property. FIPs' distance traveled before decay grows fast when their mass gets smaller. As a result, this parameter space for FIPs is practically inaccessible to collider experiments, e.g. require an order of magnitude longer figucial volumes compared to collider detectors. 

Argue that existing infrastructure of CERN can be upgraded to deliver 4E19 protons at 400GeV on a dedicated beam lamp, achieving 3 - 4 orders of magnitude higher than HL-LHC in run 4. This will be the next 10 - 15 years in parallel with HL-LHC. 

During this period, major inflow of astrophysical and cosmological data is expected, e.g. GAIA, DESI, EUCLID, Vera Rubin Observatory, E-ELT, JWST, and later SKA.
