## 20251114 Meeting Log 


- missing timescale, extremely important for timescale 

- can say more about background greatly suppressed, less than 1 event per second
- dominant background is about neutrino, not true for muon. Muon can be suppressed, but can't do anything about neutrino. 
- CoM energy, need to be very specific about energy, future a few TeV neutron beam for optimization can be available 
- last paragraph phaser not relevant, this is a fixed target experiment, muon shield is only needed for beam dump and fixed target. We are discussing of usage of high energy beams, it should has much lower sensitivity and shape. 
- best sensitivity after 5 GeV, our proposal can improve this sensitivity by a few magnitude, like best magnitude after xxx GeV. 


Should we describe more on background suppression mechanism? Following: 

1. how does the veto system (veto tagger) and particle identification work? How does it tag the particle and identify the particle? by charge and energy? 

- [ ] interesting point: difference between vacuum vessel, nitrogen vessel and helium vessel. Why switch from vacuum vessel to helium filled? vacuum is better no? Tested that a significant source come from interaction with vessel wall? 

- tagger difficulty, measure modification of helium, not difficult but need to modify the taggers to meet the new requirement for helium

- SPS, extracted during one second, 10E+10 muons, detector time, random combination of muons read by detectors, they could mimic decay signals. 
- Muon can also interact with surrounding materials. Bounced from the wall and get back to acceptance detector. Muon did not go straight. Can produce strange particle by flying in the decay volumes can go back. 
- When talk about muon shield need to also include background generated from these
- called halo muons, uncorrelated in time about readouts, mostly coming straight in beam dump. Not large. 


- [ ] The report (Sec 3.1) mentions the final decision between the fully warm and hybrid (SC/NC) muon shield options is planned for the end of 2025. Given we're so close, could you share the current status of this decision and the key performance or cost trade-offs you're still weighing? And it mentioned using machine learning to optimize this. 
	- time and money, SC cost 3 million and more R&D 
	- my proposal, 2nd part, can say SC option, we propose Super conducting for future option
	- 25th November Open presentation 
	- 5TeV, current option is high temperature superconductor,
